Hi! I'm a 2nd year Computer Science PhD student at UC Santa Cruz. Currently a project lead on creating a cyberdefense coding eval for frontier AI models through [Supervised Program for Alignment Research (SPAR)](https://sparai.org/), where our project won the First Place Best Poster award ($2000!). My work has been supported by GPU compute credits from Prime Intellect, Lium.io, and Modal. 

Lately, my latest interests are creating evals for agents and RL with LLMs. I've also been working on RL enivronments for Prime Intellect's Environments Hub, you can check them out [here](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/user/rose)!
